# Object detection and tracking

Mian purposes of the project are:
* detecting object using Haar classifier cascade
* using implemented in OpenCV library tracking methods to track detected object
* using Kalman filter algorithm to be able to track that are obscured

This project was a part of the end test of the computer vision course.

## Requirements
* Python 3.7
* OpenCV 4.4.0
